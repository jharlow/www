My initial commit on my first "`neovim` config" repo was September 26, 2023. While I was learning `vim` motions and dabbling with configs a little bit before then, that repo feels like a good milestone for what counts as "a year of doing the thing", so I'll go ahead and declare my first `vim` birthday (ðŸŽ‚)!

I'm currently the sole engineer in my org that uses a terminal-based editor as their main development tool, which I take as proof that my choice isn't a wise one. Indeed, when I chose to try it out back in September last year, I said I would dip my toes in as a learning aid, with the intention to then return to something more sensible like IntelliJ.

So, what did it aid me to learn? Is it something I'm going to stick with?

## It forced me to learn `vim` motions

I'm now good at `vim` motions! Surprise, surprise, I also now appreciate the massive value of an ergonomic text editing system. Being able to edit a document without moving far from the home row has been a massive boost to my productivity and my wrists.

I also think editing with motions is _fun_. When I have a complex but repetitive task in my code editor, I enjoy puzzling over how to do it using a macro and I save some time in the process. Reducing the time, space, and effort required to get my thoughts into an editor has given me a whole new sense of flow and given my brain more space to think about logic over editing.

Did I mention how portable it is? When I do move back to a conventional editor, I'll bring `vim` motions with me - and I've even started to appreciate sites that implement `vim` motions (shoutout to [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/)).

## It forced me to get real comfy in the terminal

On one screen, I have a `tmux` terminal window. On the other screen, I have [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) and Slack. For most of my work days, that's all I need. I can flip between projects with unbelievable speed, ignore the mouse, and automate most of my repetitive dev work.

Clearly, that's not all `neovim`. I've had to invest time into learning `tmux`, scripting, [my dotfiles](https://github.com/jharlow/dotfiles), and all the other commands/tools I've put on my Mac. That being said, I'm confident I wouldn't have taken the time to set up and learn all that if I wasn't in the terminal all day with `neovim` anyway. Making the terminal a first-class citizen on my Mac, not just a window you open occasionally or a pane in VSCode has helped me really get stuck into it.

Once again, portable? I could completely gut my `neovim` config and I'd still be 10x as powerful with a terminal as I was a year ago.

## It forced me to improve my development workflows

When opening your editor takes **93ms** and editing becomes as snappy as `neovim` is, all your auxiliary development workflows start to feel sluggish by comparison. Do I need to open a web app for this? Can I avoid this with a script? Can I extract data X automatically? Minor frustrations to me at the speed I was editing last year feel painful when the actual work goes faster,

Perhaps that's my natural development as an engineer, but I think a large part is `neovim` making me appreciate how much faster I can do my work by investing time and effort into my tooling.

## Maybe I'll stick with it a little longer

Now I've written that all out, I'm struck by how much juice I've gotten out of squeezing this particular lemon for a year. It hasn't always been a perfect experience, I've had my fair share of frustrations configuring my setup, and eventually I'm sure I'll want to hand off most of the work of that configuration to a company like IntelliJ. For now though, I suspect I'm sticking with it. If for no other reason (besides the ones above) than I enjoy it.
