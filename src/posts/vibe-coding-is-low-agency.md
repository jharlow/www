## We should be arguing about how, not if

The claims around vibe coding can spin your head. They range from actively upending the entire industry, to having already done so when you weren't looking. A lot of ink has been spilled, and a lot of job security has been crushed.

Personally, I'm now fully bought in that AI is an essential skill for modern software engineers. This year, I've switched from `neovim` to Cursor and AI is now deeply integrated into my workflow. If you are building non-groundbreaking web-apps, I'm convinced that this technology is already a force-multiplier, and it's only getting better.

Given that, I find the discourse around AI frustrating. Overall, my sense is that the backlash to these new tools stem in no small part from elitism. Technical people feel challenged by a new paradigm that has eroded their professional moat, and understandably lash out. You see people smugly deriding the work of people just starting out, gleefully (and distastefully) gloating when they get DDoS'd. A lot of them are using the bottom tenth percentile to characterize the entire toolset, and using that as a lazy excuse to avoid learning how to leverage it well.

I also think that these arguments obfuscate a much more interesting conversation we could have about how we should transition into using AI. For example...

## Optimize for slope, not y-intercept

Broadly, there are two camps emerging in the "AI is the future" camp. Those who will use it as an accelerant on their growth curve, and those who use it as a brake. In many ways, I think "vibe coding" has just given us a name to identify the latter camp.

The end-state of vibe coding is the complete abstraction of low-level implementation details. The engineer thinks at systems level, the AI does the code plumbing. That'll be amazing when we get there, but clearly we aren't yet. Maybe we will be someday, at which point I'll review my take, but you have to evaluate these tools where they are. Anyone failing to do that is in the future predictions business, or is failing to live in reality (often these are the same thing). What I'm think I'm observing is that the biggest advocates of "vibe coding" seem to be so keen to avoid the implementation details that you start to suspect they actively _want_ to avoid learning about them.

This avoidance is going to harm these people, because it limits them in two ways. One, is that until AI agents are truly as good as software engineers (have fun predicting that one), your knowledge is capped at the level of AI agents, which is to say, not very high. The second, is that it put's you in a low-agency frame of mind.

One of the saddest things I hear about "vibe coding" is:

> _"Oh, just keep regenerating until you get a version that works"_

I think this is an awful approach work if you want to improve over time. You are viewing your outputs as being constrained to the constraints of a single tool in your arsenal. But you shouldn't be constrained at all. You should see your brain as fundamentally capable of solving this problem, and that AI is merely helping you to get there by making it easier for you to learn. Surrendering that frame of mind is a very dangerous tar pit.

## Get out of the tar-pit

Use the tool, but use it to push you to new heights. Let it take you through most of the low-value boilerplate quickly, and spend more time extending/challenging yourself to improve. Understand where you went wrong in the prompt and guide it home!

I believe there are massive gains to be had in developer productivity in AI today (again, today, not six to twelve months from now), but they are mostly being reaped by people who use these tools to turbo-charge their own growth trajectory:

- Never done mapping before? You can get in-context example code in the blink of an eye to get started with.
- Trying to get though the monotonous, boiler plate stuff quickly so you can push yourself on the complex parts of your system? That's easier than ever.
- Struggling to find the right words to describe some pattern in the codebase that you want to research and understand? You no longer need to wait for a staff developer/mentor to respond to you.
- Trying to build a large surface area quickly? Spend more time than you could previously setting up high-quality patterns, and less time copy and pasting as your let the AI "do-it-for-you".

People in this high-agency mode of thinking are using AI as a learning-tool just as much as they are using it as a craft-tool. What distinguishes them from "vibe coders" is that they are using AI as an accelerant rather than a ceiling, and historically you should bet on slope. They're also having more **fun** than vibe coders because they feel empowered rather than reliant and valuable rather than replaceable.
