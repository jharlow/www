I'm a multidisciplinary professional combining expertise in software engineering, community organizing, and education to solve hard problems. Presently, I am building accounting automation products for [Bench Accounting](https://bench.co).

I want to use the 80,000 hours in my career to contribute to a more ethical, sustainable, and accessible society.
