While I'm proud of all the successes listed on this page, I am a firm believer that the lowest divisible unit of contribution is that of your team. I hope this presentational style highlights that most of these successes belong to the high-performing teams that I am proud to have been a member of.

Items are loosely ordered to balance recency alongside significance.
